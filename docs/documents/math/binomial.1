Family Objects for Models
 
 Family objects provide a convenient way to specify the 
 details of the models used by functions such as glm. 
 See the documentation for glm for the details on how 
 such model fitting takes place.

.PP
\fBlink\fB \fR\- 
 a specification For the model link Function. This can be
 a name/expression, a literal character String, a length-one
 character vector, Or an Object Of Class "link-glm" (such 
 As generated by make.link) provided it Is Not specified 
 via one Of the standard names given Next.
 
 The gaussian family accepts the links (As names) identity, 
 log And inverse; the binomial family the links logit, probit,
 cauchit, (corresponding To logistic, normal And Cauchy 
 CDFs respectively) log And cloglog (complementary log-log); 
 the Gamma family the links inverse, identity And log; the 
 poisson family the links log, identity, And sqrt; And the 
 inverse.gaussian family the links 1/mu^2, inverse, identity 
 And log.
 
 The quasi family accepts the links logit, probit, cloglog, 
 identity, inverse, log, 1/mu^2 And sqrt, And the Function
 power can be used To create a power link Function.
