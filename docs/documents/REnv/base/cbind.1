 (generalized) vectors Or matrices. These can be given as 
 named arguments. Other R objects may be coerced as appropriate, 
 Or S4 methods may be used: see sections 'Details’ and 
 ‘Value’. (For the "data.frame" method of cbind these can 
 be further arguments to data.frame such as stringsAsFactors.)

 this option affects the column merge speed. When this option is 
 set to TRUE, then cbind function will check the row order at first
 and then do row re-ordering for column appends.
 When this option is set to FALSE, then the cbind function will
 merge the dataframe directly without any row order checking. So
 you must ensure that the row order is keeps the same when doing
 non-strict cbind invoke.
