Garbage Collection
 
 A call of gc causes a garbage collection to take place. 
 gcinfo sets a flag so that automatic collection is 
 either silent (verbose = FALSE) or prints memory usage 
 statistics (verbose = TRUE).

.SH DETAILS
.PP
A call of gc causes a garbage collection to take place. 
 This will also take place automatically without user 
 intervention, and the primary purpose of calling gc is 
 for the report on memory usage. For an accurate report 
 full = TRUE should be used.
 It can be useful To Call gc after a large Object has 
 been removed, As this may prompt R To Return memory To 
 the operating system.
 R allocates space For vectors In multiples Of 8 bytes: 
 hence the report Of "Vcells", a relic Of an earlier 
 allocator (that used a vector heap).
 When gcinfo(TRUE) Is in force, messages are sent to the 
 message connection at each garbage collection of the 
 form:
 
 \fB
     Garbage collection 12 = 10+0+2 (level 0) ...
     6.4 Mbytes of cons cells used (58%)
     2.0 Mbytes of vectors used (32%)
 \fR`
 
 Here the last two lines give the current memory usage 
 rounded up To the Next 0.1Mb And As a percentage Of the 
 current trigger value. The first line gives a breakdown 
 Of the number Of garbage collections at various levels 
 (For an explanation see the 'R Internalsâ€™ manual).
