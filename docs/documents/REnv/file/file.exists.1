\fIfile.exists(\fBfiles\fR as any, 
\fBZERO_Nonexists\fR as boolean = FALSE, 
[\fB<Environment>\fR]);\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBfile.exists\fR returns a logical vector indicating whether the files named by its 
 argument exist. (Here ‘exists’ is in the sense of the system's stat call: a file 
 will be reported as existing only if you have the permissions needed by stat. 
 Existence can also be checked by file.access, which might use different permissions 
 and so obtain a different result. Note that the existence of a file does not 
 imply that it is readable: for that use file.access.) What constitutes a ‘file’ 
 is system-dependent, but should include directories. (However, directory names 
 must not include a trailing backslash or slash on Windows.) Note that if the file 
 is a symbolic link on a Unix-alike, the result indicates if the link points to 
 an actual file, not just if the link exists. Lastly, note the different function 
 exists which checks for existence of R objects.
