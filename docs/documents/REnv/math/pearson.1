Pearson Correlation Testing in R Programming
 
 Correlation is a statistical measure that indicates 
 how strongly two variables are related. It involves 
 the relationship between multiple variables as well. 
 For instance, if one is interested to know whether 
 there is a relationship between the heights of fathers 
 and sons, a correlation coefficient can be calculated 
 to answer this question. Generally, it lies between 
 -1 and +1. It is a scaled version of covariance and 
 provides the direction and strength of a relationship. 
 
 this function measure a Parametric Correlation â€“ Pearson correlation(r): 
 It measures a linear dependence between two variables (x and y) 
 is known as a parametric correlation test because it depends on 
 the distribution of the data.
 
 Pearson Rank Correlation is a parametric correlation. 
 The Pearson correlation coefficient is probably the most
 widely used measure for linear relationships between two 
 normal distributed variables and thus often just called 
 "correlation coefficient".

.SH VALUE
.PP
1. r takes a value between -1 (negative correlation) and 1 (positive correlation).
 2. r = 0 means no correlation.
 3. Can Not be applied to ordinal variables.
 4. The sample size should be moderate (20-30) For good estimation.
 5. Outliers can lead To misleading values means Not robust With outliers.
