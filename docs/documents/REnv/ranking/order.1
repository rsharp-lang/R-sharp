.SH NAME
order \- Ordering Permutation
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fIorder(\fBx\fR as <generic> Array, 
\fBdecreasing\fR as boolean = FALSE, 
[\fB<Environment>\fR]);\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Ordering Permutation
 
 order returns a permutation which rearranges its first argument 
 into ascending or descending order, breaking ties by further 
 arguments. sort.list is the same, using only one argument.
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
\fBx\fB \fR\- a sequence of numeric, complex, character or 
 logical vectors, all of the same length, or a classed R object.
. 
.PP
.PP
\fBdecreasing\fB \fR\- 
 logical. Should the sort order be increasing or decreasing? 
 For the "radix" method, this can be a vector of length equal to 
 the number of arguments in .... For the other methods, it must 
 be length one.. 
.PP
.SH VALUE
.PP
An integer vector unless any of the inputs has 2^31 or 
 more elements, when it is a double vector.
.PP
.SH DETAILS
.PP
In the case of ties in the first vector, values in the second are 
 used to break the ties. If the values are still tied, values in 
 the later arguments are used to break the tie (see the first 
 example). The sort used is stable (except for method = "quick"), 
 so any unresolved ties will be left in their original ordering.

 Complex values are sorted first by the real part, then the imaginary 
 part.

 Except for method "radix", the sort order for character vectors will 
 depend on the collating sequence of the locale in use: see 
 Comparison.

 The "shell" method is generally the safest bet and is the default 
 method, except for short factors, numeric vectors, integer vectors 
 and logical vectors, where "radix" is assumed. Method "radix" stably 
 sorts logical, numeric and character vectors in linear time. It 
 outperforms the other methods, although there are caveats (see sort). 
 Method "quick" for sort.list is only supported for numeric x with 
 na.last = NA, is not stable, and is slower than "radix".

 partial = NULL is supported for compatibility with other implementations 
 of S, but no other values are accepted and ordering is always complete.

 For a classed R object, the sort order is taken from xtfrm: as its help 
 page notes, this can be slow unless a suitable method has been defined 
 or is.numeric(x) is true. For factors, this sorts on the internal 
 codes, which is particularly appropriate for ordered factors.
