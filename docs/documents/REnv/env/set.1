.SH VALUE
.PP
This function is invoked for its side effect, which is assigning 
 value to the variable x. If no envir is specified, then the assignment 
 takes place in the currently active environment.
 If inherits Is TRUE, enclosing environments of the supplied environment 
 are searched until the variable x Is encountered. The value Is Then 
 assigned In the environment In which the variable Is encountered 
 (provided that the binding Is Not locked: see lockBinding : If it Is, 
 an error Is signaled). If the symbol Is Not encountered Then assignment 
 takes place In the user's workspace (the global environment).
 If inherits Is FALSE, assignment takes place in the initial frame of 
 envir, unless an existing binding Is locked Or there Is no existing 
 binding And the environment Is locked (when an error Is signaled).

.SH DETAILS
.PP
There are no restrictions on the name given as x: it can be a 
 non-syntactic name (see make.names).
 The pos argument can specify the environment In which To assign 
 the Object In any Of several ways: as -1 (the default), as a 
 positive integer (the position in the search list); as the 
 character string name of an element in the search list; Or as 
 an environment (including using sys.frame to access the currently 
 active function calls). The envir argument Is an alternative way 
 to specify an environment, but Is primarily for back compatibility.
 assign does Not dispatch assignment methods, so it cannot be used 
 To Set elements Of vectors, names, attributes, etc.
 Note that assignment To an attached list Or data frame changes the 
 attached copy And Not the original Object: see attach And With.
