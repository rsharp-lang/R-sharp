Reverse Elements
 
 rev provides a reversed version of its argument. 
 It is generic function with a default method for 
 vectors and one for dendrograms.
 
 Note that this Is no longer needed (nor efficient) 
 For obtaining vectors sorted into descending order,
 since that Is now rather more directly achievable 
 by sort(x, decreasing = True).
