[\fB<Environment>\fR]);\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION

Generate All Combinations of n Elements, Taken m at a Time
 
 Generate all combinations of the elements of x taken 
 m at a time. If x is a positive integer, returns all 
 combinations of the elements of seq(x) taken m at a 
 time. If argument FUN is not NULL, applies a function 
 given by the argument to each point. If simplify is 
 FALSE, returns a list; otherwise returns an array, typically 
 a matrix. ... are passed unchanged to the FUN function, 
 if specified.
